========

Peroxide aims to be a clone of the Proton Bridge free of all the bloatware that
makes things easy for casual Windows users, but makes power users cringe. The
goal is to make it:

 * buildable with simple `go build`
 * runnable as a systemd/launchd/whatever service
 * easy to merge the upstream changes to the communication protocol
